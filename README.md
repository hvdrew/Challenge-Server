# Challenge Server

A server intended to handle the tracking, reporting, and storage for an upcoming challenge with coworkers.

Requires MongoDB, Node (LTS is fine), and NPM/Yarn.

Run `npm run start` or `yarn start` to start the server. Make sure MongoDB is running, otherwise it won't function fully.
